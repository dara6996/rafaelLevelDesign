##Design Goals

####For this level my goal was to get the player accustomed to more difficult play by adding in Enemies that were easy in the first part of the level and then enemies that were significantly harder in the second half of the level.

####My other goal was to get the player familiar with the sensitivity of movement and the controls by making the last part of the level a platform jump where the end of the level is at the top platform. I wanted to put spikes in between the jumps and set the damage to 5 so that the player has to traverse the platforms perfectly with jump and side to side movement. I wasn't able to get the spikes in because when I tried bringing it into the scene it would want me to save a new animation and I wasn't sure where to go with that.

####I didn't want to make this level too difficult as I imagined it being one of the first basic levels that try to teach you as you play.

##Feedback
#### I assumed the player knew all the controls before and the player did not know how to kick enemies making the level much more harder for the player. The player did get stuck in between the tall pillars I made. I mentioned I wanted to do spikes for the floor there so the player actually hits game over so that would be my simple fix for it. The difficulty of the level I'd say was medium, players definitely lost lives quite a bit through the first run. The difficulty definitely gets way easier when you teach the player that they can attack the enemies but the platform still adds a it of difficulty as it is basic but not any easier to traverse then most platforms.
#### The level I aimed to design I believe was effective in the sense that it would be a starter level to slowly teach the player the absolute basics of the gameplay.
